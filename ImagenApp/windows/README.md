# Windows Platform Setup for ImagenApp

This folder is a placeholder for the Windows platform support in your React Native project.

Since you are developing on macOS and cannot run Windows-specific commands locally, please follow these steps on a Windows machine to complete the Windows platform setup:

1. Ensure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

2. Install the react-native-windows package (already added in package.json).

3. Run the following command in your project root to initialize the Windows platform:

   ```
   npx react-native-windows-init --overwrite --version 0.78.4
   ```

   This will create the full `windows/` folder with native code and project files.

4. After initialization, you can build and run the Windows app using:

   ```
   npm run windows
   ```

5. For more details, visit the official React Native Windows documentation:

If you want to contribute to Windows development or build the app on Windows, follow the above instructions on a Windows environment.

This placeholder is to indicate Windows support is planned and partially configured in this project.
